A Blueprint for the Digitisation of the first ever Decentralised Ontological Organisation - Episteme

## Pretext
- Social Networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter etc. are on the verge of a cataclysmic change. Unless these social networks transform themselves to become decentralised ontological organisations, they will fade into an oblivion. Episteme is a Decentralised Ontological Organisation created by Semiott Society to transform the social networks. 

## Context
- Social Networks are the manifestation of an epistemological instinct in the internet society in the early 2000s. 
- It was a nascent spirit among the millenials to get more closely connected with their own age groups. 
- From the initial instincts, these social networks slowly moved into a social capital structure. 
- It has generated a lot of commoditisation and monetisation of social relationships.
- The real and relative value of social capital faded slowly due to excessive inteference of industrial capital.
- EPISTEME is an attempt to revive the original spirit and self of social networks and social business systems.
